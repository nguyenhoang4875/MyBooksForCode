1.2 Basic survival skills
	Installing Linux
	1.2.1 The Linux file system

		etc/ Program configuration files	
		var/ Frequently changing content
		home/ User account files
		sbin/ System binary files
		bin/ User binary files
		lib/ Shard libraries
		urs/ Third-party binaries
	1.2.2 Getting around: Linux navigation tools
		Five most basic command:
			ls ( LIST )
			pwd ( PRESENT WORK DIRECTORY )
			cd ( CHANGE DIRECTORY )
			less ( DISPLAY FILE CONTENTS )
	1.2.3 Getting things done: Linux file management tools
		touch: create file.
		Detail file : stat fille_name.
		Create directory: mkdir dir_name.
		Remove directory: rmdir dir_name ( when directory empty)
								rmdir -f dir_name ( when directory not empty absolutely want delete)
		Copy and moving file: cp file1 newdir
									   mv file2 newdir
		To move all the contents of the current directory to some other location,
		you might do something like this:	 mv * /some/other/directory/
		If you had files named file1, file2...file15 and wanted to moveonly those between file1 and file9, 
		you’d use the question mark ( ? ) instead of the asterisk:	 mv file? /some/other/directory/
		Deleting file: rm file1 || $ rm file* || $ rm -r * (root) 
	1.2.4 Keyboard tricks
		Cutting and pasting:
			Ctrl-c (copy) and Ctrl-v (paste)
			Bash shell session, but Shift-Ctrl-c and Shift-Ctrl-v
		Tab completion: 
			Tab show hint.
	1.2.5 Pseudo file systems
		For instance, you might be curious to know how much total space you’ve got on
		 $ cd /sys/block
	1.2.6 Showing ’em who’s boss: sudo
		By default, the user created during the initial Linux installation will have sudo powers.
