approaches such as suitable naming—is crucial. You think naming identifiers isn’t

Seiton, or tidiness (think “systematize” in English). There is an old American saying:
A place for everything, and everything in its place. A piece of code should be where
you expect to find it—and, if not, you should re-factor to get it there.
Seiso, or cleaning (think “shine” in English): Keep the workplace free of hanging
wires, grease, scraps, and waste. What do the authors here say about littering your
code with comments and commented-out code lines that capture history or wishes for
the future? Get rid of them.
Seiketsu, or standardization: The group agrees about how to keep the workplace clean.
Do you think this book says anything about having a consistent coding style and set of
practices within the group? Where do those standards come from? Read on.
Shutsuke, or discipline (self-discipline). This means having the discipline to follow the
practices and to frequently reflect on one’s work and be willing to change.
